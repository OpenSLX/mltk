Patched scripts:

Some virtualbox script are patched to accomodate some changes in system
environment: As openSLX uses predominantly busybox, paths to busybox exe-
cutables (respective links) are inserted. These insertions are made at the
end of paths, as sometimes there are system binaries predomninantly used,
for example ps, as busybox ps does not offer needed options.

This patched scripts include virtualbox and vboxmanage, originally links
to VBox. Please note these patched scripts are unlinked, thus solitary,
please note there is also a (linked) scripts named VBoxManage (note capitals).

It is therefore recommended to use the lower case version (vboxmanage).


systemd capabilites:

The systemd-udevd compiled within the module systemd lacks a capability in
the environment variable DEVTYPE at least in regard to USB devices, so an
entry ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device" in an udev rule file rule will not work.

This applies to several versions, tested so far 195, 204, 206.
In contrast to this a hand-copied distribution binary will work flawlessly
within the openSLX biotope.

It does not seem possible right now to circumvent this problem, as this kind
of problem seems to be unknown  even irc/systemd development group. So as a
workaround the systemd-udevd will be restarted in addon-init. But the danger
of losing queue messages needs to be kept in mind, and if a solution arises,
the udevd restart line should be deleted.
