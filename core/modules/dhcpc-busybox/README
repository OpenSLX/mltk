This module requires that busybox udhcpc is present in stage 3.2

The default setup builds busybox with udhcpc, puts it in stage 3.1
which copies it to stage 3.2 before the switchroot happens. That's
why there is no direct dependency in this module's .conf: busybox
is not part of the stage 3.2 target.
