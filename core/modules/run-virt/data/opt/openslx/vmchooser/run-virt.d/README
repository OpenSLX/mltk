## NOTES ##
Only independent things in here please! We don't want to start with inter-feature dependencies...
Simple ordering could be done via numerical prefixes...

## USAGE ##
* Try to use some easy keywords and functions! e.g. sound -> setup_sound
* Basic include file should look like:
	# example.inc
	handle_example() { echo "Handling example..."; }
	reg_feature_handler "example" "handle_example"
* Do not try to reg a function which was already registered, this won't work
  (Maybe one day we want to support overwritting handlers, but not at the moment.)
* Only *.inc files are included by the mechanism!

## MLTK INTEGRATION ##
FEATURE -> MLTK MODULE:
sound -> amixer
print -> printergui
firewall -> slxfwtool (TODO own fw mltk module)
netshares -> TODO network share mltk module
slxfloppy -> TODO externalize the floppy creation stuff from the run-virt mltk module
