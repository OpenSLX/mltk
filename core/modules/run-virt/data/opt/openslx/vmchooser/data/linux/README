This package consists of the following scripts:

vm_installer: 	This script is to be started once in a local, permanent (so 
		not within the pool system environment) virtual machine. It 
		writes a systemd service file and links it, so the scripts 
		for resolution setting and mounting network shares will be 
		started at boot time at boot time via vm_runtime.
		It may be run from the mounted (pseudo) disk drive /dev/fd1
		or from elsewhere.
		init will be supported at later time.
vm_runtime:     Will be started at boot time and patches Xsetup, so the 
		scripts mnt_shares and resolution will be started at graphical 
		login.
mnt_shares:     Reads the config file shares.dat from (pseudo) disk drive and 
		mounts therein given network shares.
resolution:     Sets resolution within the virtual machine according to base 
		system resolution given via config file openslx.ini.

resolution_standalone: Standalone version of resolution sctipt. Needs no 
		preliminary work done by systemd or vm_runtime.
		One has to embed/start it via adequate means by hand.
