This package consists of the following scripts:

vm_installer: 	This script is to be started once in a local, permanent (so 
		not within the pool system environment) virtual machine. It 
		writes three systemd service files and links them, so the 
		scripts will be started at system startup resp. shutdown:

resolution:     (after display-manager.service): Sets resolution within the 
		virtual machine according to base system resolution given via 
		config file openslx.ini, and re-checks it for some time..

mnt_shares:     (after basic.target): Reads entries remapMode (and 
		createMissingRemap, todo) from the file openslx.ini, and 
		mounts the shares given by shares.dat according to remapMode. 
		mounts therein given network shares.

resolution_standalone: Standalone version of resolution sctipt. Needs no 
		preliminary work done by systemd or vm_runtime.
		One has to embed/start it via adequate means by hand 
		(Xsetup/Xreset).
